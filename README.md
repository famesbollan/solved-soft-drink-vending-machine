Coke($1.00)

Root beer ($1.00)

Figure below shows an example of the application form at run time. (The images that are displayed are in student sample programs)

When the application starts, the vending machine will have 20 of each type of soft drink. Each time the user selects a drink, the application should subtract 1 from the quantity of the selected drink. It should also update and display the total amount of sales. If the user selects a drink that is sold out, a message should be displayed indicating so.
